# nRF24L01P-For-STM32F1
An improved module for nRF24L01P for STM32F1 microcontroller

This library is part of MJNET Project, a Lightweight and Self-Configuration Protocol for Smart Home and implementing on an STM32 Based Gateway.

it is a fork of https://github.com/r2aiv/NRF24L01-1 (TNX @r2aiv).
it has some improvement including:
* Add nRF Timeout for freeze prventing
* Seperate pip addresses for working and initializing

I hope be useful. :)
